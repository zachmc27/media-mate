# CineMatch

## 🎬 About the Project
CineMatch is a web application that helps users find the perfect movie to watch with their friends. Users can pick a genre, sort through movies within that genre, and compare their picks with their friend's choices. Once both users complete the Flick Picks process, CineMatch will recommend movies that they have in common, making movie night decisions easier!

- **Friend System**: Add friends to your profile and compare movie preferences.
- **Watch Later**: Tracks movies a user would like to watch.
- **Seen It Tracker**: Tracks movies a user has already watched.
- **Movies For You**: Analyzes the genres of movies users have watched to determine their top preferences.
- **Popular & Recently Released Movies**: Displays trending and highly rated films.
